This project is about merging the data of Train and Test, extracting the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, and overall, testing the ability to get, grab the raw data into tidy data that is available for the data analysis.

The script first reads in the data tables of both Training and Testing data. Then merge them into one data.frame.
This process takes a while but it gets completed.

Then, by using dplyr package, we can filter for mean or standard deviation by using y_txt file that has the labes of the data.

Reading the final results need to be done to see whether the dataset is tidy or not.
